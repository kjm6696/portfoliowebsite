                <p>Information, People and Technology presents the high points of an education in the College of Information Sciences and Technology. It opens an intellectual journey through the ideas and challenges that IT professionals face in the world. It will address major questions such as: How can we use technology to organize and integrate human enterprises? 
                    How can technology help people and organizations adapt rapidly and creatively? What can we do about information overload?Three perspectives (or facets) address the core issues: information or the basic science of data encoding, transmission and storage; people or the interactions among technologies, institutions, regulations and users; and technology
                     or the design and operation of basic information technology devices. Students completing the course will be confident users and consumers of information technology. Students will develop research and analytical skills to evaluate specific devices and understand how those devices function in larger socio-technical systems. Students will be able to
                      predict and anticipate the impact of new technologies on human institutions as well as understand the potential impact of institutions on the use and design of information technologies.The course employs an action-oriented approach. Students learn by doing-formulating and solving problems drawn from professional contexts, detecting and recovering 
                      from errors related to technology use, and locating, reading and studying materials that support their analysis and problem-solving. Students will accomplish this by participating in team-based learning. The course provides students with the opportunity to use, modify, and evaluate software to search for, frame, and express ideas with fluency. A variety
                       of mechanisms are used to assess student performance. These evaluation methods typically include exams, quizzes, homework assignments, group projects, and peer and self-assessments. </p>

                <p>Introduction to concept of databases including the storage, manipulation, evaluation, and display of data and related issues. IST 110 is recommended as preparation for IST 210. IST 210 Organization of Data (3) As the database management software becomes one of the critical components in modern IT applications and systems, a solid understanding 
                    of the fundamental knowledge on the design and management of "data" is required for virtually any IT professionals. In a business setting, such IT professionals should be able to talk to the clients to derive right requirements for database applications, ask the right questions about the nature of their entities and in-between relationships in
                     their business scenarios, analyze and develop an effective and robust design to address business constraints, and react to the existing database designs as new needs arise. Modern IT professionals should be able to guide a company in the best use of the diverse database-related technologies and applications toward the "Big Data" era. As such, IST
                      210 aims to prepare students for obtaining fundamental understanding on the database concepts and practical skills to analyze and implement a well-defined database design. In particular, IST 210 provides an introduction to physical database design, data modeling, relational model, logical database design, SQL query language, and instructors' choices
                       on database applications and advanced concepts. Students will learn to use a real-world commercial or open-source database management system, too. Upon taking IST 210, students should be able to understand the implications and future directions of databases and database technologies. </p>

                <p>Introduction to digital network topologies; transmission media, signal modulation, digital packet switching and routing, systems integration, communications management, and security. IST 110 is recommended as preparation for IST 220. The course includes an introduction to: telecommunications history; telecommunications transmission media (conducted and radiated);
                     transmission characteristics (including an introduction to coding and modulation techniques); error characteristics, detection, and correctional; local and wide area networking applications, hardware, and software; the OSI models; industry standards; topologies; protocols; internetworking devices; communications management; security and recovery; information
                      system applications; and the selection of telecommunications and networking systems. Special attention will be paid to evolving Internet Protocol (IP) technologies, e.g., Internet2. IST 220 is an introduction to digital networking and telecommunications and their applications in information systems. It is a required core course for both the two-year and four-year
                       Information Sciences and Technology degrees, and is a critical part of the curriculum. Its objective is to provide the students with a basic understanding of the working of digital networks and the ability to apply this knowledge to specific applications and situations. Evaluation of knowledge objectives will be by examination; and of application (i.e., selection and management)
                        objectives by grading of group and individual projects and case studies. As a "core course", IST 220 will be offered every semester at University Park, in as many sections as necessary to meet current demand. At other locations where the Associate and Baccalaureate degrees are offered, it will be offered 1-2 times annually depending on demand. Ideally, section 
                        size should not exceed 45 students per class. While the course is about digital technology and how it works, it is not a "hands on" course, or a training course in particular equipment and/or applications. While there will be demonstrations of relevant technologies, the course is not equipment-intensive and will not involve special technology needs beyond the normal
                         access to computing and the Internet. The course is not duplicative of any other course currently offered. Although there is some overlap with CMPET 401-402, CSE 458, and COMP 421, none of these courses cover exactly the same material, and they operate at a different level of depth and detail. M I S 180 also overlaps somewhat, but it appears that no current course
                          provides the same 200-level mixture of local and wide-area networking and business communications topics. </p>

IST 261 Application Development Design Studio I (3) This studio course will provide opportunities for students to practice the technical skills acquired in their foundation application design and development courses, specifically, in IST 140 and IST 242. The course will follow the general format of experiential 
                    studios in the arts and architecture. It will be primarily problem-based and project oriented. Peer and instructor design critiques will be the major feedback and assessment mechanisms. Students in the IST Software Design Studios will be expected to complete deliverables in each phase of the systems development lifecycle (i.e. problem definition, requirements analysis, design, development, test)
                     regardless of the development paradigm employed (plan-based, agile, etc). A key objective of this design studio will be to introduce students to the challenges faced in different application design and development activities before exposing them to specific techniques to manage these challenges in upper-division courses. Projects may be undertaken by individuals, pairs, or larger 
                     groups but each studio participant will be responsible for producing significant individual project deliverables. Project ideas may come from the student or from the instructor; however, projects related to students' other course deliverables will require the agreement of both instructors. Students will be required to maintain a design and development journal. This journal will be 
                     the analog of an engineering notebook or artist's sketchbook and should contain a running account of the students design and development ideas, explorations, rationale, and other notes. The IST design and development studios are a forum for serious students to engage with the concepts, process, tools, and materials used to envision and build software applications. Both collaboration 
                     and individual performance will be emphasized, as will experimentation, risk-taking, and enthusiasm for the process of designing and building working software applications.
