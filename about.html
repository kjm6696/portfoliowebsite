                    <h1>Introduction</h1>
                    <p>My name is Koben Milam, I am 23 years old, and located in western Maryland. I began college unsure of what I wanted to do, and after a turning point in my life, I decided to embark on my journey studying IST (Information Science and Technology). 
                        I am currently unemployed and studying full-time. I am driven by the joy of creating fun projects and improving the user experience in already created applications/ projects. As a career, Iâ€™m not so picky as I love most of what I do. Some highlighted
                        fields I would love to get a job in are Front End Development, Application Development, and IT. I am a loving and caring person. I also enjoy creating quality work within a team or even in a solo environment.</p>

                    <p>I was born in Arizona on December 21, 2000, and lived there until I was about 3 years old. My family and I moved to a town in Pennsylvania known as Hanover. This town is where I spent the majority of my childhood and where I made all my friends.
                        During my adolescents my spark for technology really started. I began learning how to build computers at a young age and started gaming on a PC. After graduating from High School I was unsure what I wanted to do, so I enrolled at Shippensburg University 
                        with an Undecided/Exploratory Major. During my time at Shippensburg University, Covid-19 moved me into an online learning environment. After the pandemic, I decided to apply to Penn State University Park and began my journey studying IST. I now graduate with 
                        a bachelor's degree in the fall semester of 2024 where I hope to already had an internship and I can begin my professional career.</p>

                    <h1>Education</h1>
                    <p>I went to High School in Hanover PA. After Highschool I enrolled at Shippensburg University in 2019 majoring in their undecided program where I just take general education courses and stayed there until Spring of 2021. I then transfered to Penn State University in Fall of 2021 initially majoring in Animal Science,
                        I had a love for animal and really wanted to do something with them but after a semester I realized that I wanted to do something with technology. I then switched my major to IST (Information Science and Technology) where I am currently studying full-time and plan to graduate in the Fall of 2024.</p>
